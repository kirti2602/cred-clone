            <p>trust as a virtue has consistently played an essential role in every great human achievement. and

                felt
                it was time someone gave it the spotlight it deserves. especially for the ones who live by this virtue:
                the
                trustworthy.</p>

            <p>
                so we thought of creating a system that rewards its members for doing good and being trustworthy. this
                way,
                trust as a virtue becomes something to aspire to, just the way it should be. then we went one step
                ahead: we
                built it. we know we are on the right track because here you are.
